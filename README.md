# numeric
Numeric is a numpy replica done in kotlin. At the moment the goal is to add as many features for vector operations without consern for optimazitions. 

## Getting Started
Gradle Dependency
```
repositories {
        jcenter()
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
   }
   dependencies {
         implementation 'com.github.jalexcole:numeric:0.0.1'
   }
```
 


### Primary Goal
Add in as many numpy features as possible and optimize as nessary.

Incorporate into Numerical Methods.

### Later Goals
Incorporate JEP 338 into a jvm section for further optimization.
